[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/aeonian.png)](https://nodei.co/npm/aeonian/)

I've built this to help supply a continuous delivery [git-flow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) workflow hosted on an AWS serverless setup 

###  What does this do? 
Running `.deploy('{environment}')` will do the following:
1. Create a new S3 bucket `{prefix}-{commit-hash}-{environment}` based on the current repo and config
2. Upload the contents of a local directory you specified as `localDir` 
3. Configure the newly created bucket as a static website 
4. Change the origin of the CloudFront ID associated to point to our new bucket's website URL
5. Initiate an invalidation on `*` making the Distribution pull the new bucket's content
6. Delete the previous bucket that was assigned as the origin as to not leave a trail of buckets

### Example
Let's say you have a script `operations/staging.js` with the following
```javascript
require('aeonian').config({
  bucket: {
    localDir: './dist/',
    prefix: 'mysite-'
  },
  website: {
    index: 'index.html',
    error: 'error/index.html',
  },
  environments: {
    staging: 'CLOUDFRONT_ID',
    production: 'CLOUDFRONT_ID',
  }
}).deploy('staging')
```
Running this would result in

</p>

Which would deploy `./dist/` to your S3+CF `staging` environment

### Installation

* Install the aeonian package
`npm install aeonian` or `yarn add aeonian`
* Set the current environment variables to your AWS key and secret for the [AWS JS SDK](https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-node-js/)
  * `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
  * `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
  * Other options on this step can be found [here](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v2/developer-guide/setting-credentials-node.html)

### CircleCI Integration
This is mostly why aeonian exists, to deploy based on commits.  Based on the example above, lets say you have scripts `operations/staging.js` and `operations/production.js` in your repo.  you could then add the following to your `package.json`
```javascript
"scripts": {
..
  "staging": "node operations/staging.js",
  "production": "node operations/production.js",
..
},
```
After setting your AWS credentials on CircleCi, you could add something like this to your `circle.yml`
```yaml
deployment:
  staging:
    branch: staging
    commands:
      - npm run staging
  production:
    branch: master
    commands:
      - npm run production
```
* Any commit/PR merge to the `staging` branch would deploy the `staging` environment
* Any commit/PR merge to the `master` branch would deploy the `production` environment

Please submit a PR or an issue once you get this running, so I can update this
### TravisCI Integration
Please submit a PR or an issue once you get this running, so I can update this
### Nuxt.js Integration
The main reason I built aeonian is for my all of my [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org/) projects. I have the following commands in my `package.json` that I have CircleCI run based on environment

```js
  "scripts": {
    ...
    "production": "yarn generate; node operations/aeonian.js production",
    "staging": "yarn generate; node operations/aeonian.js staging",
    ...
  },

```
